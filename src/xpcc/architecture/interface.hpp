	 * \brief	Interface class
	 *
	 * This class defines acts as a base class for all classes describing the
	 * public interface of common peripheral drivers.
	 * As there is no implementation given, the classes specific to the platform
	 * inherit from their respective base classes and must shadow the methods of
	 * them.
	 *
	 * The inheritance is only visible for the documenation, it is completely
	 * removed during compile time keeping a possible error at platform level.
	 * This is safe, because only one platform can be compiled at once.
	 *
	 * This way, no virtual functions are needed and no overhead is generated,
	 * but we still have clean inheritance in the documentation.
	 * There is no need to document the platform specific implementation, since
	 * it is taken from the base class.
